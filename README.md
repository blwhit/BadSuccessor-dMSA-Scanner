# BadSuccessor dMSA Scanner

**A PowerShell tool to detect ALL BadSuccessor attack paths in Active Directory _(including nested/group privileges)_.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è About BadSuccessor

BadSuccessor is a critical privilege escalation vulnerability in Active Directory that allows attackers with dMSA creation or modification rights to impersonate ANY Active Directory user account.

### Details:
- Affects Windows Server 2025 environments only
- Currently has no available patch
- Enables takeover and credential theft of ANY AD user account (e.g. Domain Admins)
- Attack requires privilege to create/modify dMSA object

### BadSuccessor TLDR:
1. Attacker creates/modifies a dMSA account
2. Sets two attributes to "link" it to a target/victim user (e.g., Domain Admin)
3. Authenticates as the dMSA and gains *all target user's privileges*

## üîç What This Scanner Finds

This tool identifies who can exploit BadSuccessor by checking:

- **Direct dMSA Permissions**: Accounts with explicit rights to create/modify dMSAs
- **Group-Based Permissions**: Users who inherit dMSA rights through group membership (including nested groups)
- **OU-Level Creation Rights**: Permissions allowing dMSA creation in organizational units
- **Container-Level Creation Rights**: Permissions allowing dMSA creation in containers
- **Existing dMSA Modification Rights**: Write access to current dMSA objects
- **Environment Assessment**: Windows Server 2025 domain controller detection

  ###### _NOTE: Highly privileged pricipals are automatically filtered (e.g. Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, Domain Controllers, etc...)._

## üöÄ Quick Start

```powershell
# Scan entire domain (recommended)
.\BadSuccessor-dMSA-Scanner.ps1

# Check specific user
.\BadSuccessor-dMSA-Scanner.ps1 -User jdoe

# Export to CSV
.\BadSuccessor-dMSA-Scanner.ps1 -CSV

# Fast scan (skip groups)
.\BadSuccessor-dMSA-Scanner.ps1 -SkipGroups
```

## üìã Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-User <name>` | Check specific user |
| `-All` | Scan all users (default) |
| `-CSV` | Export results to file |
| `-SkipGroups` | Skip group analysis (faster) |
| `-h` | Show help |
